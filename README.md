# easy381
Package to help students navigate the R language in SD Mines' MATH 381 course

The goal of this package is to add a collection of functions to make the experience of using R easier for students who are not comfortable in their programming skills. There are two types of functions in the package. First, a function that gives help on which R commands are needed to do what specific to each Quest. Second, functions that simplify/reduce the number of commands that need to be entered to get a result. This is due to students being concerened if they can memorize all of the commands, especially when some of the individual parts do not make sense to them.
